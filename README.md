Shell scripts by Aaron Clement
I hate writing these, but there's nothing quite as satisfying or easy as adding a new terminal command that does exactly what you need.

## Installation
These scripts are written in Bash, and I really only intended them to be run on my Mac. To get them working as "native" commands, you'll have to create a file in `~/` named `.bash_profile` with a single line: `source ~/shellscripts.sh`. This tells the Terminal to load this script whenever it starts a new session, and likewise you should place the shellscripts file at that location for Terminal to read.
